  database sources. This was not possible yet. The filtering also has a 
  secure end timer, which avoids that the timelimit hits the script.
- Added support to suppress unparseable messages when using msgparsers.
  This enhances useability if you have mixed data sources, and want to
  filter out unparseable messages.
- Added new setting for MYSQL logstream sources to control the amount 
  of data per query. This value can be used to tweak the MYSQL 
  performance. For example when filtering for fields which are generated 
  by a message parser, highering the value does improve the database 
  performance. The default value is 100, and should only be changed if 
  you know what you are doing. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.15 (beta), 2008-10-22
- Corrected the check for magic_quotes_gpc which is important when saving 
  configuration values are saved into the UserDB. This also fixes a 
  problem of duplicating backslahes when using \ or ' in string fields.

  admin with possibility to customize width and alignment of fields,
  and add new custom ones. 
- Added new table into user database to support the custom fields. This 
  requires a database upgrade. 
- Add admin panel for message parsers. This includes further information
  on the parsers as well as the option to import necessary custom fields
  for the message parsers. 
- Overall simplified code related to field definitions and types. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.13 (beta), 2008-10-07
- Improved documentation, added general and search description. 
- The conversion script does convert the charts now as well.
- Added global warning which will be displayed on all pages if a 
  database update is pending
- Added button below searchfield which becomes visible when 
  you run searches which links to the asktheoracle site. 
- Fixed a race condition in the installer which could cause phpLogCon 
  to fail at Step 8.
- Added parser for apache2 common format. So we support apache combine 
  and common now. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  incorrect redirect login page during install. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.11 (beta), 2008-09-25
- Fixed the "next page" button when a logstream disk source was used. 
  The "next page" button stopped working as a side effect of some
  performance changes made in the last version. 
- Added new description field for logstream sources. If the description 
  field is used, the description is shown below the pager on the 
  main index site. The database version has also been incremented, this 
  only affects you if you are using the user system. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.10 (beta), 2008-09-24
- Merged devel branch into beta branch.
- Enhanced search performance in disk logstream, specially when searching 
  in large files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.9 (devel), 2008-09-19
- Implemented support to analyze Webserver logfiles from Apache and
  Microsoft IIS Webserver. There is a collection of new fields available,
  filtering is possible. . In order to read Apache or IIS logfiles, 
  you need to use the "iis" or "apache2" message parser in your disk 
  sources. 
- Added a new page called "asktheoracle.php" which will be automatically 
  linked on IP's and domain names. It is a simple helper page which 
  creates a bunch of usefull filter links.

  does also link to this documentation now (Help Menu Entry).
- Added a general option to limit the display of string fields. 
- Added a general option to configure the timeout value of popup menus. 
- Added a general option to alter the php scrip timeout. This is of course 
  only possible if the php interpreter is allowed to change the script 
  timeout. 
- Added checks for the script timeout in the disk logstream, this avoids
  that the script is suddenly stopped by the php interpreter. 
- Fixed a sorting bug in the disk logstream, which removed numeric 
  values in the charts
- Added support to filter for a + character as well now. In order to filter
  for strings containing the + character, just add replace it with ++. 
  A single + will still be equal to a space character in the filter engine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.8 (devel), 2008-09-16
- Added Bitstream Vera Fonts into the package which will be used by the

- Added filter / search support for processid, event category and the 
  event user field
- Added database update, as we now have a new table to store 
  configured charts into.
- Fixed a few minor filtering issues, specially with numeric filters.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3.11 (beta), 2008-09-08
- Fix another parsing issue in the logline parser. Most of RFC 3164
  formatted syslog messages should now be correctly splitted into their
  fields. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.6 (devel), 2008-09-03
- Implemented Message Parser facility. This new extendable facility of 
  phpLogCon helps splitting messages into fields. And the fields can
  be filtered and searched for, this expands the full potential of 
  phpLogCon. A message parser for windows eventlog logfiles generated 
  by Adiscon products is included. 
- Linebreaks within messages are now displayed in the popup window, 
  and the detail page. 
- Added Database Upgrade functionalety, the reason is simple, because 
  there was an update to the database structure. If you are using the
  User Management system, you will be prompted to upgrade your database
  next time you login. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.5 (devel), 2008-08-28
- Added option to send debug messages (warnings and error's) from 
  phpLogCon to the local syslog server on linux. On Windows, the debug 
  messages will appear in the application event log. 
- Enhanced the PDO Logstream Driver for better performance on large 
  databases. On MYSQL and POSTGRES, the PDO Logstream does not uses the 
  LIMIT statement to minimize database usage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3.10 (beta), 2008-08-27
- Fixed a few parsing issues with prior RFC 3164 syslog messages. 
  These messages are now correctly parsed, or better do not cause
  any parsing problems anymore. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.4 (devel), 2008-08-05
- Included fixed from Beta v2.3.9
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3.9 (beta), 2008-08-07
- Fixed a bug in the parsing of RFC 3164 date and time stamps which 
  occured from the 1st to the 9th of each month. During this time, the 
  date was not correctly parsed.

  annoying. It still can be turned off very easily.
- Fixed an image alignment problem of the message once and for all. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.3 (devel), 2008-08-05
- Added support to export the current visible events into a XML or CSV 
  file. If you have further recommendations for useful export file 
  formats, just let us know in the phpLogCon forums or mailinglist.
- Extended Filter Engine to support Full and Partial Text searches on
  string fields. The submenu buttons also now use the Full Text search
  by default, which performs much better on database logstream sources. 
- A new menu entry on each value on each field in the main EventView 
  gives you the option to search for this field only, or extend an 
  existing filterset. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.2 (devel), 2008-08-01
- General Options are now configureable on user basis, if UserDB System
  is installed of course. This means first, phpLogCon used the global
  configured options, then the user configured - if available. 
- When you add new Sources, the source is checked with better error details. 
  If you have a database connection, even the existence of the configured
  table is checked. This helps locating configuration problems. 
- Fixed minor bug in the installer which was added in v2.5.0.
- Fixed spelling errors in the admin index template. 
- Error messages in the admin center contain more useful details now.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.1 (devel), 2008-07-29
- Added a new option to suppress displaying multiple messages. This
  means if you have two or more messages of the exact same text one after
  another, only ONE message will be shown. This helps to "compress" the
  logview a little bit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5.0 (devel), 2008-07-24
- Fully implemented the UserDB System. This is the next major milestone 
  in the development of phpLogCon. The new UserDB System allows you to 
  fully customize phpLogCon using an admin interface and offers the 
  following sub-features: Users, Groups, Sources, Views, Searches and 
  general options. Exiting configurations can be imported into the 
  user system using the convert.php script. The installer has an option 
  to install the user system.

- Enhanced the detected of IP Addresses and domain names, so the automatic
  generated context links match better now.
- Added new option (enabled by default) to resolve IP Addresses into
  hostnames. Note that this will only be done if the IP Address is NOT in
  square brackets. The resolved names will be cached in the users session, 
  to speed up the resolving process. The resolved IP Addresses will be 
  injected behind the IP Address in curly brackets, and a diffirent colour. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3.4 (devel), 2008-06-02
- Added new feature to automatically link IP and domain names with our

  found.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3.3 (devel), 2008-05-23
- Initial Added the new DB Driver (Logstream) which uses PHP PDO. 
  PDO is the latest generic database interface for PHP5 and recommended 
  for best performance. It is possible to use other database engines with 
  this new logstream class like mssql, postgres sql, odbc, oracle 
  or even ibm db2.
- Optimized the logic of the pager and increased performance 
  related to it. 
- Added support for the new Database driver into the installation script.
