<H1>HOWTO install LogAnalyzer</H1>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2>Abstract</H2>
<P><I><B>In this paper, I describe how to install <A HREF="http://loganalyzer.adiscon.com">LogAnalyzer</A>.</B>
It is intentionally a brief step-by-step guide, targeted to those who
want to quickly get it up and running. For more elaborate
information, please consult the rest of the <A HREF="manual.html">manual
set</A>.</I></P>
<H2>Steps To Do</H2>
<H3>To install LogAnalyzer, you need:</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Apache or IIS Webserver
	<LI>PHP5
</UL>
<P>Optionally, you may need:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>MySQL Database</P>
</UL>
<P>For obvious reasons, you also
need some syslog data. Any standard syslogd will do. From a feature
and stability point of view, we recommend either one of these (which
we also wrote ;) ):</P>
<UL>
	<LI><a href="http://www.winsyslog.com/">WinSyslog</a> (for the Windows platform)
	<LI> <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com">rsyslog</a> (for the Linux/Unix platform)
</UL>
<P>Both of them are also capable
of writing to databases. Rsyslog is a drop-in replacement for stock
syslogd and also *is* the stock  syslogd on some platforms (e.g.
Fedora 8 and above).</P>
<H3>Step 1 - Download Software</H3>
<P>For obvious reasons, you need to download LogAnalyzer. Here, I
assume that you use a distribution tarball. 
</P>
<P>Load the most recent build from
<A HREF="http://loganalyzer.adiscon.com/downloads">http://loganalyzer.adiscon.comdownloads</A>.
Extract the software with &quot;tar xzf -nameOfDownloadSet-&quot;.
This will create a new subdirectory LogAnalyzer-version in the current
working directory. CD into that. 
</P>
<H3>Step 2 
</H3>
<P>Upload all files from the loganalyzer/src/ folder to you webserver.
The other files are not needed on the webserver. 
</P>
<H3>Step 3 
</H3>
<P>If your webserver has write access to the LogAnalyzer folder, you
can skip the following step: 
</P>
<P>     
</P>
<P>	Upload the scripts configure.sh and secure.sh from the contrib
folder to your webserver, into 	the same folder where you uploaded
the other LogAnalyzer files into. Then set the execution 	flag to them
(chmod +x configure.sh secure.sh).          
</P>
<P>	Now run ./configure.sh, this will create a blank config.php, and
will also set write access to 	everyone to it.         
</P>
<P>         	You can of course do this manually if you want. 
</P>
<H3>Step 4 
</H3>
<P>Now open your LogAnalyzer installation in your favourite webbrowser,
you will see an error, and you will be pointed to the installation
script. The install script will guide you through the LogAnalyzer
installation, just follow the instructions.</P>
<H3>Step 4.1</H3>
<P>Prerequisites Beginning of installation / welcome site. This is
the first page of the installation. It just tells you, that before
installing, some file permission have to be checked. Simply click
&quot;Next&quot; to start the process.</P>
<H3>Step 4.2</H3>
<P>Verify the file permissions Here you will see, if the config.php
can be written or not. If it cannot be written, you have to repeat
the complete Step 2.</P>
<H3>Step 4.3</H3>
<P>Basic Configuration</P>
<P>You can set several basic options here. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Number of syslog messages per page = 50 (default)</P>
	<P>This is the number of syslog messages displayed on each page. You
	can increase the value (makes LogAnalyzer slower) or decrease the
	value (makes it faster).    
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI>Message character limit for the main view = 80 (default)
	<br>Set the number of characters per message which will be shown in
	the last column of the main view. Full messages can be reviewed by
	hovering the mouse over it. <b>Many folks prefer to use a setting
	of "0", which means complete messages will be displayed</b><
	<LI>Show message details popup (default yes) = yes (default). Note that many
	people find the popups intrusive and prefer to disable them. Use "no" in this
	case.
</UL>
<H3>Step 4.4</H3>
<P>Not implemented yet, some real magic may happen here at a later stage ;-) - for
now, just skip it.</P>
<H3>Step 4.5</H3>
<P>Create the first source for syslog messages. This is the most
important step. Here, you will configure your first data source,
which holds all your syslog data.</P>
<P>Mainly, you have to choose a &quot;Name of the Source&quot; and a
&quot;Source Type&quot;. The name will be displayed later in a
drop-down menu with which you choose your active syslog source. The 	
      &quot;Source Type&quot; can be a file, a MySQL database or the
PHP PDO which supports different database types like mssql,
PostgreSQL, odbc, oracle or even ibm db2.</P>
<H6>If you choose the diskfile, you have to provide
the following information:</H6>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Logline Type = Syslog / Rsyslog (default) or Adiscon
	WinSyslog</P>
	<P>This tells LogAnalyzer, how the lines look like. This is necessary
	for show the log messages properly.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Syslog File = /var/log/syslog (default)</P>
	<P>This is the position of the logfile in your file system. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H6>If you choose MySQL native as data source,
following information is needed:</H6>
<UL>
	<LI>Table Type = monitorware (default)</P>
	<P>This is the table layout. Currently, you can use &quot;monitorware&quot;
	or &quot;syslogng&quot;. For more details see &quot;Note on MySQL
	Databases&quot; below.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database Host = localhost (default)</P>
	<P>This is the host, where the database is located. By default this
	is localhost. You can specify any other host if necessary.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database Name = loganalyzer (default)</P>
	<P>The name of the database you want to use.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database Tablename = systemevents (default)</P>
	<P>This is the name of the table in which the data is stored. The
	default tablename corresponds to the tables created with the
	MonitorWare Line of products.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database User = user (default)</P>
	<P>The username for the database.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database Password = not set by default</P>
	<P>The password for the username.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Enable Row Counting = No (default)</P>
	<P>If configured to &quot;Yes&quot;, the amount of rows in the table
	will be counted with every query, giving you the total records for
	your search, though having a lot of impact on your system when using
	      a very large database. If configured to &quot;No&quot;, the
	rows will not be counted, providing you a lot more performance.	    
		</P>
</UL>
<H6>If you choose Database (PDO), the following has
to be defined:</H6>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database Storage Engine = MySQL Server (default)</P>
	<P>Choose the engine of the database you are using. These databases
	are supported: MySQL Server, Microsoft SQL Server, ODBC Database
	Connection, PostgreSQL, Oracle Call Interface, IBM       DB2,
	Firebird/Interbase 6, IBM Informix Dynamic Server, SQLite 2.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Table Type = monitorware (default)</P>
	<P>This is the table layout. Currently, you can use &quot;monitorware&quot;
	or &quot;syslogng&quot;. For more details see &quot;Note on MySQL
	Databases&quot; below.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database Host = localhost (default)</P>
	<P>This is the host, where the database is located. By default this
	is localhost. You can specify any other host if necessary.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database Name = loganalyzer (default)</P>
	<P>The name of the database you want to use.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database Tablename = systemevents (default)</P>
	<P>This is the name of the table in which the data is stored. The
	default tablename corresponds to the tables created with the
	MonitorWare Line of products.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database User = user (default)</P>
	<P>The username for the database.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Database Password = not set by default</P>
	<P>The password for the username.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Enable Row Counting = No (default)</P>
	<P>If configured to &quot;Yes&quot;, the amount of rows in the table
	will be counted with every query, giving you the total records for
	your search, though having a lot of impact on your system when using
	a very large database. If configured to &quot;No&quot;, the rows
	will not be counted, providing you a lot more performance.	      
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>Step 4.6</H3>
<P>Finish :)</P>
<H3>Step 5</H3>
<P>If everything went right, you should see syslog messages already
in your LogAnalyzer installation. You can now remove the install.php
script now. 
</P>
<H2>Note on Accesing Files</H2>
<P>In most environments the webserver has only access to the web
directory. If you want to read files e.g. from /var/log/ you have to
grant the necessary permisson to your webserver.</P>
<P>A note for linux systems that have <strong>SELinux</strong> enabled, you will 
most likely get an access denied error when trying to access logs in /var/log 
regardless if the file permissions are correct. </P>
<P>Of course, you always need to make sure that the user the web
server runs under also has the correct file permissions. Be careful
when doing this, you may create a security vulnerability by granting
too much to too many users.</P>
<H2>Note on MySQL Databases</H2>
<P>LogAnalyzer does support using a MySQL database as syslog source.
LogAnalyzer supports Adiscon's MonitorWare database schema. The schema
used by php-syslog-ng is also partly supported. That schema, however,
is somewhat inefficient in that it stores facility and severity codes
as textual values. We do not currently convert these values back to
their native format and consequently facility and severity can not be
taken from a php-syslog-ng database.</P>
